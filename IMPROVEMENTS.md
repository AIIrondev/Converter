# Audio Format Converter - Improvements

## Error Handling Improvements

The Audio Format Converter application has been updated with the following improvements:

1. **Improved Error Handling**:
   * Fixed pydub error messages showing "Error using pydub: [WinError 2] Das System kann die angegebene Datei nicht finden"
   * Eliminated unnecessary error messages during successful conversions
   * Added more robust error handling for FFmpeg operations

2. **Optimized FFmpeg Usage**:
   * Replaced the pydub conversion with direct FFmpeg usage for better reliability
   * Added `-hide_banner` and `-loglevel error` flags to FFmpeg to reduce unnecessary output
   * Suppressed console window creation with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag on Windows

3. **Other Enhancements**:
   * Improved error message filtering to only show serious errors
   * Enhanced logging to provide clearer information
   * Added proper error handling for file not found issues

## Using the Improved Converter

The application workflow remains the same:
1. Choose your source and target formats
2. Select input and output directories
3. Use the "Check Folder" button to analyze your files
4. Click "Convert" to process your files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure FFmpeg is installed and accessible
- Check that you have appropriate permissions for the input and output folders
- Verify that your audio files are not corrupted

The improvements made should eliminate the unnecessary error messages while maintaining full functionality.
